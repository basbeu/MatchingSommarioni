# MatchingSommarioni

This repository contains the code of the step 4 of a pipelining project done in context of course Foundation of Digital Humanities (DH-405) at EPFL.

Refer to the main [repository](https://github.com/Jmion/VeniceTimeMachineSommarioniHTR) of the project to access to the whole pipeline.

The goal of this step is to establish a matching between an excel file and some extracted data from Sommarioni. 
The full documentation and explanation of the project can be found on the [project wiki page](http://fdh.epfl.ch/index.php/Deciphering_Venetian_handwriting).
